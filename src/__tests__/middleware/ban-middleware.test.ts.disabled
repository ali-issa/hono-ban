/**
 * NOTE: Full middleware tests are currently disabled due to a known issue with Bun's testing framework.
 * There's a bug related to mocking in Bun that causes errors when testing middleware.
 *
 * Possible workarounds for future implementation include:
 * - Using bun-bagel: https://github.com/DRFR0ST/bun-bagel
 * - Using bun-mock-fetch: https://github.com/aryzing/bun-mock-fetch
 * - Using spyOn for global.fetch
 *
 * These tests should be expanded when the Bun testing framework is more stable.
